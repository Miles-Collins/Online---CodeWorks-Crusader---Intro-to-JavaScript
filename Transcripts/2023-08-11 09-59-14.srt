1
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:13,498
So that's going to be what we'll cover for
the Primitive types before we dive into our
project

2
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:18,922
And now we'll actually go into making our
project

3
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:27,652
And today we're going to be building out
together The Adventures of the code Works
Crusader

4
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:33,081
and today we're going to be building out the
adventures of the code Works crusader

5
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:53,027
I'm going to show it off really quick

6
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:32,309
So once this project is finished we'll
create this interactive game it'sOn where we
were at.

7
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:38,947
Once we finish this project we're going to
have this interactive gameA click game I
want to say click game.

8
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,077
After our project is finished we have this
interactive clicking game so the purpose of

9
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:48,645
this game is we're going to create some
JavaScript for whenever I click on this

10
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:53,083
What's going on

11
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:02,463
?

12
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:10,872
I typed clear

13
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:16,343
into the

14
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:21,814
wrong spot

15
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:38,951
So once we're finished with the project
we'll have this interactive clicking game

16
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:50,433
All right one more time let's take it from
the top

17
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:56,612
After we finish this project we'll have this
interactive clicking game application

18
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:01,848
And when I select this attack button you'll
notice both of our health go down and

19
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:09,665
we're going to be building this out using
JavaScript and connecting that to our
indexWill also hopefully.

20
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:16,933
If we will give ourselves a random chance to
actually spawn in a potion to find a potion
and when

21
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:22,262
we do find that potion we're going to create
something where we can actually see that
potion pop up

22
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:28,321
And then we're going to create this button
here to actually add Health to our pool

23
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:34,790
And right now it's set up on an interval so
you can see it took a little bit of time so
let me try to get another potion

24
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:41,266
If I click this right now it's set up on a
three second intervalAnd then we get that
Health there.

25
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:53,344
We're also going to show off the get element
by ID and that's how we're going to input
these images here

26
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,238
I'm going to use a lot of arrays

27
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,547
Actually use a race I take that back

28
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:30,429
We're going to mainly create a lot of
functions it's going to add functionality to
our web page

29
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:36,053
Yeah I think I already kind of said it
though didn't I

30
00:04:54,366 --> 00:05:02,232
So we'll be incorporating

31
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:10,098
a lot of the

32
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:17,964
information we just

33
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:25,830
went over for

34
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:33,696
our primitive types

35
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:41,563
into this project

36
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:49,391
And I look forward to building this
alongside you guysI don't like that last
part.

37
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:08,356
And let's go ahead and get into building out
the codeworks CrusaderBam Bam Bam.
