1
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:24,379
Let's first get started and our index at
HTML

2
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:35,764
And let's go ahead and add the adventuresOf
the code Works Crusader here.

3
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:56,316
The next thing we need to take care of is we
don't know longer going to be working with
this intro.jsWe need to create another file
here.

4
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,042
And we're going to name this file our
main.js

5
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:14,843
I'm going to want to get rid of this intro
cuz we're going to actually create a whole
new file for all the JavaScript we're going
to have for the adventures of the codework
Crusader

6
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:22,344
So let's do the same thing we did earlier
with the intro let's just log hello from
main.js here

7
00:01:24,903 --> 00:01:28,293
And let's make sure we actually get that
loaded up onto our screen

8
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:40,502
Dang itOh Lord. Stop it.

9
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:54,295
Got to keep remembering f11Fabriccons I
don't care about favicons.

10
00:01:57,362 --> 00:02:00,746
So it's refresh this page and we actually
get that hello from main.js

11
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,398
So at this point we know that our JavaScript
is linked up with our web application or Dom

12
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,712
So let's now get rid of this hello world
header and we'll start adding some of the
items we

13
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:27,225
need in there we're just going to kind of
add them in like our old low Fidelity
mockLike we made last.

14
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:38,380
So I'm going to start by kind of Destruction
is almost like our low Fidelity mock from
our figma lecture

15
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:47,548
And just get a lot of the items on the
screen that I want to work withAnd just get
the functionality this application working
first and then at the end we'll.

16
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:51,823
go ahead and style it up to actually make it
look like that final product

17
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:58,564
So let's head back to our index.html

18
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:57,100
Okay yeah I'll sing that about replacing
that fabric on butI won't worry about it for
now it doesn't matter.

19
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:04,720
So let's go ahead and just delete this H1
here we don't need that guy

20
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:11,150
We'll go ahead and add in our

21
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:17,434
Oh man I didn't do it the way I would
normally would over here

22
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:32,456
So I'll go ahead and start with my mainI
won't be using a header tag here.

23
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:39,129
Just because of the structure of this
application and then I'm going to start with
a section tag

24
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:47,952
And then in that section tag we're going to
make sure weMake it a container fluid.

25
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:05,573
And now I want to just quickly set up well
dang it get too far into styling

26
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:13,793
I'll be backWell now let me give you one
thing oh my goodness.

27
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:29,108
I'm going to quit create a quick row here
cuz I need somewhere to put the two health

28
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:34,637
bars and then I'll do a couple call six here
so we're going to do two call six

29
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:39,823
I'm home I'm talking like a spazSo I'm going
to make two column sixes here.

30
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:45,241
And we can do that by doing call Dash 6 and
we can just do times two

31
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,909
And this first call is going to represent
the hero

32
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,880
And this next call six is going to represent
the villain

33
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:12,441
And we're going to keep this simple for nowI
want to create some sort of.

34
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,129
Header for this so I like to create Rose so
I'm going to do another row here

35
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:22,984
And then I'm going to do a call 12 for now

36
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:33,765
And I just want to create a P tagAnd this is
going to be my heroes.

37
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,425
HealthAnd then we'll start at zero.

38
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:48,617
We can go ahead and just copy thisAnd we'll
move this down to our villain.

39
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:52,680
Instead of hear yourself we'll just change
it to villain's health

40
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:59,681
We'll just start at 100 for bothCool.

41
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,543
And after this I'm going to want to create a
button

42
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:27,989
So it's going to be in its own different row
underneath of it for nowThis is going to be
a.

43
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:36,114
Call three and let's go ahead and just use
our button classAnd we will say attack.

44
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:53,204
Our button will just say type buttonWe'll
just give it a class of B10 BTN. Outline for
now.

45
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:03,469
Great so let's go check this out at our web
application see what it looks like

46
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,318
He looks really good huh

47
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:39,238
So right now we got ourTwo Health at the top
and our attack I'm going to go ahead and
give that top row of some.

48
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:47,221
Padding just so we can get some breathing
room from the top of the pageSo let's go
ahead and just give this a.

49
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:49,329
Padding top five for now

50
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:56,468
Let's actually just make this a container as
well so we can get some of the gutters on
the side

51
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:08,687
SweetAwesome so this looks a little bit
easier to work with.

52
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:19,226
I'll do the same thing here I'm just going
to give this someI'll give it actually a
little bit of Marge on the top and we'll
just justify.

53
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,112
ContentContent Center as well.

54
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:31,493
I don't actually like the will do outline
Dart So It Isn't So blending in so muchSo
great.

55
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:39,751
We have the foundation of how we want this
project to be started withCuz the idea now
is I have my health.

56
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:44,343
For my hero in my villain and I also have
this button to attack

57
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:51,000
So now we need to go into JavaScript
actually create some variablesOr an object.

58
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:59,520
And then set those variables to actually be
able to input inside our HTML so inside our
DomSo let's go try that out.

59
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,640
I don't so let's go try that out question
mark

60
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:10,126
So let's go actually start so let's go
actually

61
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:19,377
So let's go create those objects in our
JavaScript and get that scripted into our
DomSure.
