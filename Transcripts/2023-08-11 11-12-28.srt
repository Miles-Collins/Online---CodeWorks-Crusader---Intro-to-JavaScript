1
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:10,632
So let's start in our main.js we'll get rid
of this console log here

2
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:19,244
And we can start off by just crying this
hero healthAnd we'll do hero Health equals
100.

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:26,551
And let's make sure we know these are
different we can putOur section tag up here
and we'll say hero.

4
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:36,630
And then let's go ahead and do the same
thing here and I'll say sectionVillain. No
say let villain help.

5
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,674
Equal 100 for now as well

6
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:48,428
Let's just go ahead and make this equal 150
we'll give it some some variance to make it

7
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,942
We'll give some very interest make the the
villain a little bit tougher than we areGive
him a chance.

8
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:29,808
So let's start by just creating a function

9
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:38,010
That can reduce the villain's health so
we'll actually trade a function we'll just
call this function attack for now

10
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,391
Cuz this will be that middle button in the
screen that we had

11
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:48,897
So when I clicked this I want to essentially
first have the

12
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:55,320
hero Health go down by 5:00 so let's first
console logHero Health here.

13
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:08,105
And it should be 100 at firstNext let's
actually decrease that health.

14
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:17,658
So we'll decrease the total hero Health
hereAnd we can do that simply by just saying
hero health.

15
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:21,054
And then let's do minus equals 5

16
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:32,741
And let's actually check with the hero
health isWe'll say hero Health after damage.

17
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:40,194
And let's save thatLet's go to our Dom.

18
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:54,782
And in here we can actually invoke that
attack function

19
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:02,639
And we see we get hero Health 100 and hero
Health after damage went down in 95

20
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:09,537
And we can do it again and we start with 95
so you can see we still have that 95 so it

21
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:17,246
stays it holds that scope for that hero
Health every time I do this so should go
from 90 to 85Perfect.

22
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:23,738
Now that we know this bun is operating let's
do the same thing for villain Health as well

23
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:37,109
Why is it returning undefined I'm not even
returning anythingSay return no.

24
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,499
So it's creating another section

25
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:50,889
here we'll say villain

26
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:57,008
So let's do the same thing we can say
console.log

27
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:03,632
About to attackVillain.

28
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,642
And we'll grab that bill and help as well

29
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:16,400
And we'll do minus equals 10

30
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:28,216
And we'll just say attacked the villain here
as well and let's we should have the same
result

31
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:41,957
So in our Dom let's go ahead and initialize
that attackSo we get.

32
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:45,867
So we get our hero Health hero Health after
damage about to attack villain attacked

33
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:52,050
And the cool thing is we can keep doing this
for as long as we want but we have to keep
initializing that

34
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,933
So let's make it a little bit easier on
ourselves and let's assign that function to
this button here

35
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:12,466
And to do that we have our function attack
right hereNow we need to implement this in
our on our button.

36
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:20,827
And we're going to do that by targeting this
button right hereAnd let's assign this
property of onclick.

37
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:26,371
And we're actually just going to go Target
that attack function the name of it

38
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:31,689
So it needs to be exactly the same as thisSo
if you.

39
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:40,489
Are unsure about spelling you can actually
come here and just copy itAnd then paste it
in here and let's save that and go back to
our web application.

40
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:49,251
So from here I should be able to click
attack now and we should get those console
logs to pop up

41
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:52,760
Perfect

42
00:05:53,667 --> 00:06:00,135
We have now added some functionality to our
web application and we can see it working
every time I click it

43
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:06,103
And we get these outputs from that function
we create
