1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,330
So let's not add some functionality to our
JavaScript to actually show these Health
pools

2
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:17,383
Be what they're supposed to be so my hero
Health should be 100 in my Dillon Health
should be 150

3
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:24,165
So we'll see how to kind of get those drawn
onto the page and that's awesome make it so
every time I click this attack button

4
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:28,271
It is reactive and responsive to our attack

5
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:39,898
So from here the first step I want to take
is I'm going to go ahead and not make this
100 we'll put a span here

6
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:45,768
When I actually put 100 back inAnd let's add
an ID.

7
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:54,314
And this ID is going to be what we're going
to Target in our JavaScript so I need to
make sure I have something in here

8
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:06,877
To be a placeholder when the page loadsBut I
also need this ID. To be able to.

9
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:13,381
Access it later in JavaScript so I might
just repeat myself there

10
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:20,348
So first things first we got that Span in
there with that hero health

11
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:24,876
and that span gives us the ability to wrap
that number within a

12
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,728
Element selector an element so we can put
that ID on there

13
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:43,731
So let's head over to our main.js

14
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:13,799
And let's go ahead and add a line hereSo
we'll say const hero Elam here.

15
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:19,071
Equals document so we're going to Target our
DomGet element by ID.

16
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,153
And we're going to choose that ID we had
earlier so is hero health

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,059
So what's your name I'm going to rename this
hero health elim

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:40,213
Cuz this is going to be the entire element
so let's go ahead and console logHero
healthy I'm here.

19
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:43,514
So let's save thisLet's go ahead and label
this really quick.

20
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,874
Save this go to our Dom

21
00:02:56,315 --> 00:03:02,220
From here when I click attack we can see
that I'm actually targeting that specific
span

22
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:09,032
Whenever I'm creating that Dom from whenever
we're creating that variable from that get
element by ID

23
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:13,983
So that's perfect that's exactly what I want
to select because I want to be able to

24
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:18,291
change this number in here from 100 to
whatever the new number is when they get
attacked

25
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:29,326
So now I'm going to do that is I'm actually
going to say hero Health dot ElmThat enter
text.

26
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,657
And we just want this to equalThe new hero
health.

27
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:44,556
So let's save thatLet's refresh.

28
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:52,943
So before I hit this attack buttonWhen I hit
it we should see this hero Health go down by
5:00 every time I click.

29
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,796
Due to that selector so let's click
itAwesome.

30
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,714
And we can see over here every time I'm
clicking it we get a new span with that
additional 85

31
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:10,961
And that's only happening because of we're
inserting this 85 right here into that span

32
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:17,434
So perfect now let's do the same thing for
our villain's health

33
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:31,441
So let's go ahead and concept out as well
we'll say Conn's villain Health Elam

34
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:38,515
Equals document get element by IDAnd we're
going to Target that villain Health as well.

35
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,958
And this is going to give us accessWho's
going to give us access to that span.

36
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:51,124
We're going to do the exact same thing as
well so we'll see villain healthIntertext.

37
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:56,370
Equals our new villain health because at
this point we subtracted it by 10

38
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:11,714
So if we come back here we should see every
time we click thisWe're actually making
those changes on the screen.

39
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:18,768
The right now every time we click

40
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:25,240
It goes well actually we won't talk about
that yet we'll add that later

41
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:04,561
Before we continue to our next portion of
ourActually no.

42
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:11,935
I'll probably just create everything
outYeah.

43
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,993
I mean there's not a whole lot to be honest

44
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:53,852
I mean Vocal Point cue that I am continuing
ZachAnd three.

45
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,061
TwoWhat.

46
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:12,233
There's one thing I want to point out though
when we continue to attack

47
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:18,126
We can actually go hit zero and go negative

48
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:26,057
Let's make sure we add some functionality
and make it so we if you hit zero we can't
go below zero and will you actually just win

49
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:40,440
So for thatWe can do it first with our
villains Health here.

50
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:44,131
We can say we want to make this conditional

51
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:51,983
So we want to make essentially we want to
return so stop this entire everything after
this line

52
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:56,342
If the villain's health is less than or
equal to zero

53
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:02,988
Also want to make sure if my health is less
than or equal to 0

54
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:09,041
I am a defeated as well so I don't want to
be able to continue

55
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:19,814
I don't want to be able to continue the game
on even if I don't have it so it's actually
get rid of this

56
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:26,915
I'm actually going to do thatI'll add that
in later. So villain health is.

57
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:34,908
Great or less than or equal to zeroLet's go
ahead and just return straight out of this
function.

58
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,485
Cuz our return is just going to be a hard
stop

59
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:47,874
And I'll show you what I mean

60
00:09:55,979 --> 00:10:01,428
So every time ISo every time I hit attack.

61
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:05,188
We get all the console log so let me clear
it

62
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:12,232
So I hit attack now you will see his health
is at zero and we get our about to attack

63
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:17,652
villain and all that but because we put that
conditional statement there we should only
get the hero Health now

64
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:24,131
Because after that line so it's going to do
all the hero stuff but it's going to hit
that conditional

65
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:26,939
And it's actually going to be zero at that
point

66
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:33,562
So I can show that off as well using a
debugger really quick

67
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:42,960
This is a great tool to use as well I'm a
huge debugger fan I use the all the time
whenever you're trying to figure out

68
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:50,167
something's wrong with your code and all
this is this is the line I want it to start
debugging on once I have my console open

69
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,597
So if I have it open right away as soon as I
hit this function

70
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:13,051
Didn't workI didn't save.

71
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:29,398
So as soon as I hit this button it's
actually going to pop this debugger upAnd
it's going to go through all the code but
we'll just.

72
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:37,008
Go through it for now and let's actually
close our console cuz I don't want to go
through the debugger yet

73
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:45,388
I want to go through it this moment so right
now we're at 30 health and 10 villain health
so I should go through this

74
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:52,023
Instance is villain Health less than zero
nope so we can actually use this step over

75
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:56,929
And it's going to hit this conditional it's
going to step over and it's going to make
those calculations again

76
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:00,943
But now that it's at zero health

77
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:09,339
It's going to hit this debugger it when it
took the five Health from our hero it's
going to say zero less than or equal to zero
oh it is

78
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:17,989
So step into that it's actually going to hit
this returnAnd then it's just going to exit
out of it.

79
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:28,251
So I'm still able to hit it but all the code
after this returnIt just skips because that
conditional is true.

80
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:49,088
So we will want to do the same thing with
Our Hero's Health as well

81
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:57,977
Cuz we won't want to allow him to continue
attacking eitherSo let's put the same thing
we'll say if.

82
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:01,811
Our hero health is less than or equal to
zero

83
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:12,277
We want to returnBut this time I'm going to
do something a little differently actually
going to return an alert.

84
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:19,242
This is going to be a cool window alert and
we're just going to say theCode Works
crusader.

85
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:24,448
IsDead.

86
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:33,278
And let's show you how that will work as
well so I'll actually make my house zero or
go down quicker so I can go to zero first

87
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:40,923
Let's refresh thisAnd when I hit attack
here.

88
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,335
You can see the code Works Crusader is dead

89
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:50,380
So I can no longer attack this is a not
allowing me to attack any longer

90
00:13:57,895 --> 00:14:03,797
But let's make sure everything is working
properly so if I doIf I do expect a five
save this.

91
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:13,570
Go back to our application and let's just
check to make sure everything's working the
way we want so villain's health is at zero

92
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:20,189
But we notice when we keep attacking Our
Heroes Health continues to go down even
though

93
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:26,745
The villain is technically defeated so he
shouldn't be able to continue attacking us
even when we are attacking

94
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:32,097
So somewhere in our functionality we need to
add a or statement

95
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:36,446
To make it so we stop attacking each other
all together

96
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,663
So we'll add a couple things here we'll
actually add an order here

97
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,407
And we'll say if the hero health is less
than or equal to zero as well

98
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:38,967
The main thing is we want to return
something hereSo we want to say if the boss
is health.

99
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:46,179
WowExcuse me the villain's health.

100
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:53,979
So we want to return something if the
villains

101
00:15:53,979 --> 00:16:01,977
health is 0 or below so we'll say
ifVillain's health.

102
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:07,638
Is less than or equal to 0 let's do
something similar like that alert that we
had above

103
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:20,587
I want to returnAlert. And we'll say the
code works.

104
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:27,380
Crusader Vanquish the coding virus that's
going to be the name of our villain here

105
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:32,062
No reason to there's no reason to beat a
dead horse you know

106
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:37,998
He's already dead we don't want to keep
attacking them that's kind of rude and mean
you kind of prove a point

107
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:46,098
So let's say this and head back to our
applicationAnd let's just test this to make
sure it works the way we want.

108
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:54,673
So we are going to beat them so it's
attackAnd we get that pop alert to not allow
us to continue tacking.

109
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:58,419
And neither one of our health continue to go
down
