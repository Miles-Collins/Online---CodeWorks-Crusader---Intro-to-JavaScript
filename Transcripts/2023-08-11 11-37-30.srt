1
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:08,787
So let's add a little Flair to this game cuz
right now we just have hard coded numbers in

2
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:14,714
so every time we attack no matter what I'm
going to win because the villain's health is
going down

3
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:20,641
a much faster rate than mine so we need to
add some sort of random factor to this
project

4
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:28,821
Let's head over to our JavaScript and I'll
show you all let's head over to our
JavaScript and I'll show you how to do just
that

5
00:00:54,749 --> 00:01:00,037
So from here I'm going to add that section
tag as well so we'll see section

6
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:04,204
Hero let's get rid of this debugger we don't
need this anymore

7
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:10,616
So the main important part is we have these
two checks here at the top we want to

8
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:15,237
keep these at the top cuz we don't want any
code to run if it hits this

9
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:25,019
But after that let's create a new variable
that's going to essentially be that Heroes
attackSo let's say let hero attack.

10
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:29,280
And I want this to equal

11
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:35,259
Math.random this is going to be a JavaScript
function that's built in

12
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:39,138
And I'm just going to multiply this by 10
for now

13
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:51,264
And let's go ahead and cancel out this for
nowWe want to apply it though.

14
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:55,025
Cuz I do want to show off one thing that's
going to be kind of a problem

15
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:09,475
So let's open up our consoleI want to tag.

16
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:17,599
So right now we see that we have our hero
attackAnd it's 1.4333 and it's always going
to give me a random number.

17
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:28,353
Between 0There's a good one zero and 10 I
actually got two.

18
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:35,651
very high rolls it's very low chance to get
a 9.979.02But it's just going to be a random
number between those.

19
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:53,160
And that's what I want my and that's what I
want my hero to be able to take I wanted to
be able to attack in between 0

20
00:02:53,456 --> 00:03:00,206
And 10But right now we're getting those long
integer numbers so the way a quick.

21
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:05,155
way to fix that is we can also use another
JavaScript function called math.flora

22
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,712
So if we save that and head back to our Dom

23
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:21,993
From here we can see in my hero text 96852

24
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:25,339
And we can keep going so we got a zero

25
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:31,482
And we actually defeated but there is one
problem now because of the math.4

26
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:38,002
Is that it will can never be 10It can only
be zero through nine so after this.

27
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:12,418
So let's go ahead and just change this to 11

28
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,062
Let's check it out here

29
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,549
Cuz Matt thought floors always going to
round down to the nearest number and sweet I
got my tender

30
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:31,568
And I should still be able to get a zero
awesome perfect

31
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,519
And there are other ways to do this there's
also going to be a math dot ceiling

32
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:51,252
Maybe notMaybe I'm just remember. Yeah just
act like I never said that.

33
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:10,789
So awesome from here I have my hero
attackAnd when my hero attacks.

34
00:05:12,582 --> 00:05:19,963
I wanted to crease the bosses the villains
help not by 10:00But I actually wanted to
crease the villain's Health by.

35
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,627
The amount in my hero attack

36
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:34,113
So one important thing that I kind of
switched up here is my villain Health should
go down when I attack

37
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,407
In my hero hell should go down when the
villain attacks essentially

38
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:51,255
It will change this to villain healthInstead
of going down by 10:00 here let's actually
say.

39
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:57,653
Sign it toThat variable we created which is
going to be a random number.

40
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:07,458
So now if we come back to our application we
can see it goes down by 85.

41
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,403
And then six it's going to always be a
random numberTo this point.

42
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:20,908
It's going to be completely random if I can
actually defeat the bossAnd. I couldn't beat
him.

43
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:29,861
But we do come into another issue that we're
having here is the hero health is at 5:00
when we want to be at zero

44
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:42,125
But that's also because of the place that we
have are

45
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:48,157
Hero Health going down now because it's
actually in the bottom portion of it

46
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,823
So we'll fix that once we get back to
calculating our villains damage as well

47
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:25,253
So from here I'm going to do the same thing
with my villain

48
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:36,619
Let's say let villainAttack. Equal. We'll
start with that math up for.

49
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:43,255
And we'll use that random generator cuz this
is like say this is going

50
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:48,283
to map out random will randomly generate a
number between 0 and 1

51
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,174
And that's why we need to multiply it by
either the 10 or 11

52
00:07:54,136 --> 00:08:00,750
But in this case I'm not going to do 11 I'm
actually going to make it so the boss can
attack from 0 to 60 to 15

53
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,830
He's got a little bit more damage

54
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:13,890
And we'll have the hero Health go down by
that attack

55
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:19,651
So let's go ahead and get rid of some of
these console logs as well at this point

56
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:25,660
We know they are doing exactly what we
wanted to do so there's really no point in
keeping in there

57
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:36,218
SweetSo let's refresh and when we attack
now.

58
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:47,571
We see that we're both attacking each other
for a completely random numbersAnd he smoked
me dang.

59
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:07,584
So I want to add something in here

60
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:14,308
For when the hero's Health actually goes to
zero so we'll do the same thing we'll say

61
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:22,438
If Our Hero's health is less than or equal
to zeroWill pop that alert as well.

62
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:30,051
We'll just say oh no the code Works Crusader
has vanquished

63
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:41,239
Well actually making a little will slain by
the coatingVirus. And we'll say.

64
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:47,285
RipIt's not we go back to our web
application.

65
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:56,986
If we lose again hopefully we get thatOh no
the code works great dang he hit me hard.

66
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:08,524
Wait a secondHe isn't dead.

67
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,635
What's going on man

68
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:54,813
So right now when I click through this
gameYou can see there's a little bit of an
air there with the heroes health.

69
00:12:55,165 --> 00:13:00,339
And that's because it's not getting
drawnTill I click on the bun the next time.

70
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:08,072
And this air is kind of occurring due to a
couple reasons but the main reason

71
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:15,533
Is that I have a lot of code here just all
created inside of one function

72
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:20,432
This would be the definition of not clean
code

73
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,187
There's a lot of things we can refactor into
other functions

74
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:33,438
Cuz right now we have pretty much three
functions all written to this one right now
we have

75
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:39,121
an attack by our hero you have an attack bar
villain but we also have these draws
happening

76
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:47,132
As well and that's where this conflict is
happening we need to create a function for
those first two things but we also need to
create that function for
