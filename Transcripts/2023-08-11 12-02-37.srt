1
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:19,343
I'm going to break this down into like said
those categoriesLet's create our first
function here.

2
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:22,201
And this is just going to be called hero
attack

3
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:30,381
For the most part we kind of relaxed it had
this sectioned off for this

4
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:38,837
So from here let's actually take all this
and I'm just going to control XAnd add it
down to my hero attack.

5
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:52,376
Whoops I caught a little bit of the hero
attack there myself and then awesome we get
that in there so the cool thing now

6
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,203
Is I can actually call that hero attack
function within my tag

7
00:00:57,464 --> 00:01:03,020
Even though none of this code exists up
inside this function attack anymore

8
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:07,453
When we go to our console

9
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:21,643
We will see the same functionality work
though we can actually see the villains
Health going down every time we attack

10
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:30,321
Let me actually not bringing the accounts I
didSo you're at the application whenever I
click attack we can actually still see the
villain's.

11
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:34,520
health is indeed still going down even
though we're not calling it within that
first function

12
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:42,644
So let's do the same exact thingFor our
villain.

13
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,504
So we'll just call this one the same thing
we'll just make it simple we'll say villain
attack

14
00:01:55,737 --> 00:02:02,511
Let's go to that section villain and we're
going to go all the way downUntil we hit
that.

15
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,574
Essentially what we like to call a draw
function

16
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:14,737
So after our hero attack will thenCall our
villain attack.

17
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:27,701
And we can go ahead and clean this up so you
could actually usually just get rid of your
console logs once you know they work

18
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:32,293
Waiting for this instance I'm going to keep
them in there for a referencing purposes

19
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,143
So now we actually have just these last
drawls

20
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:51,692
And I'm just going to call this one draw
health

21
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,828
Because it's just going to draw all the
health of the hero and the villain

22
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:06,500
And we can do the same exact thing here
let's just moveAll that down into that draw
Health function.

23
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:14,428
And I'll actually section this off to make
it a little cleaner so we'll say section
hero here

24
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:23,416
This guy be my section villainAwesome.

25
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,822
So the last thing we need to do here is do
our draw help

26
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:33,250
So whenever we call this attack function now

27
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:40,127
It's going to trigger that hero attack that
villain attack and then finally it's going
to draw the health of all those

28
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:46,515
And you can actually close them up over here
when you're kind of finished with that
function and you can

29
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:52,486
always reopen it as well so now the draw
should work correctly when I'm actually
clicking on the attack button

30
00:03:55,201 --> 00:04:01,368
So I should see a showSo I should see the
hero's Health actually hit zero now.

31
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,159
Unless by some rare chance I win I don't
think so

32
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:15,068
So we got the oh no the Crusaders was slain
and we get that negative fiveSo let's fix
that really quick as well.

33
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:31,871
So we'll say ifSo right now even though it
is less than or equal to and it's hitting
that alert.

34
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,926
It's going to go to the negativeSo it's
actually just say hero health. Equals zero.

35
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,064
And we'll go ahead and do theAnd we'll go
ahead and do the same for our hero attack as
well.

36
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:55,372
So before I return that we'll make sure that
the villain Health hits zero and stays at
zero and we don't want to necessarily go
below zero

37
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:04,370
So let's see that inGo back to our web
application.

38
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:09,448
And we'll hit the attack again

39
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:17,692
So we get that oh no we lost but now we get
our heroes health is at zero

40
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,617
And at this point we can no longer attack
because we are defeated

41
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:29,233
Don't know why

42
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:53,073
Soon maybe it just isn't happening quick and
it's so slow

43
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:04,299
This is me you know I'm saying thatIf I hit
this now nope it's just too slow whatever
that's fine.

44
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:22,958
So right now in our web applicationThis
isn't very fun for the hero.

45
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:30,490
I don't really have any I can't even get
them below 80 Health at this point it's ooh
99

46
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:35,739
So ice isn't a great user experience cuz it
doesn't seem like you'd

47
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:39,812
have to be the luckiest guy ever to actually
beat him right now

48
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:50,502
So let's add in that a functionThat allows
me to drink a potion.

49
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,993
And be able to heal myself for a certain
amount

50
00:06:57,703 --> 00:07:04,008
So before we do that let's actually create
that within our JavaScriptOr excuse me our
HTML.

51
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,271
So we already have our attack button here

52
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:25,164
So we'll just go ahead and create another
callWe will label this one potion.

53
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:31,563
We'll put the drink potion function on it
right now

54
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:38,110
And I want to show up right now this should
air whenever I hit this on click right now

55
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:43,932
Because that drink potion function is not
created in our JavaScript

56
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:49,597
Because right now we have nowhere that we're
drinking a potion so right now I can just

57
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,764
We'll just return no for nowWe actually can
click it. Actually it's not even do that.

58
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:16,561
Because we need to create that function
within our JavaScriptSo we'll say drink
potion.

59
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:25,407
And we can save thatNot from here it removes
that air.

60
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,327
So the idea when I drink my potion we can
have it

61
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,671
We essentially just want to increase our
hero health

62
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:20,821
We're going to just do 25 so whenever I
click that my hero Health should increase by
25So let's do the same thing that we did
here.

63
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:24,226
And draw that function up here

64
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:31,109
The biggest thing like the mistake we made
earlier is it's important of the order of
operation so I have the two attacks

65
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:40,983
No what am I talking aboutI'm high bro.

66
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:45,682
So now we made this function for drink
potion we can go back

67
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:54,509
And we can read so now we create the
functionality of the strength potion let's
go ahead and also add

68
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:03,564
No I'll do make the air on purposeSo now
this function is made for drink potion let's
go.

69
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,663
Show it off in our

70
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:12,589
Web application now that we create this
function for a drink potion let's go show
that off in a web application

71
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:22,293
So we know it's going to heal me for 25 so
let's try to hit 63 so when I drink potion

72
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:31,063
My health is still 63 but if I get it tag we
can notice that my health did indeed go up
so if I hit potion again

73
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:41,671
We can notice and we also go above hundred
so that's something we're going to want to
fix as well but that's because I draw
function

74
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:50,128
Is never happening we're never drawing our
healthSo the cool thing is we can actually
just call that function again.

75
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:51,940
Within our drink potion

76
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:58,511
And now every time I click that drink potion
it's going to call that Heroes health

77
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:05,873
But like I said there is a problem right now
cuz my Hero's Health can go above 100 and

78
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:10,068
I don't want that to happen I want it my
health to only be able to hit 100

79
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:20,002
So let's do the same thing that we did
earlier with our

80
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:28,739
With our feelings help in here if it goes
below zero we want to just set it back to
zero immediately so it never really hits
that negative

81
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:37,033
So let's say if our heroes health is greater
than 100I want you just a hard reset it to
100.

82
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:47,016
So now when I attack and I hit potion it's
actually only going to ever go to 100

83
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:52,168
cuz the second it goes above 100 it's going
to immediately just reset back down to 100

84
00:11:55,694 --> 00:12:01,103
And technically there's like a super super
millisecond where it would be technically
125

85
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:06,512
but because it computers are so fast you can
never catch that instance

86
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:21,911
But the only problem now with this
applicationIs pretty much impossible to lose
now.

87
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:29,349
Because every time I help get slowSo let's
use that math random again to create some
variety.

88
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:37,149
And when you do the same thing with our
villain Health if you know Sarah as well it
actually went below zero

89
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:42,946
Let's fix that and we'll add a little bit of
Randomness to the potion as well

90
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,728
So let's go ahead and make a conditional
here as well so we'll say ifVillain health.

91
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:35,588
Is less than or equal to zero hereLet's just
make villain Health zero.

92
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:38,634
Awesome

93
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:49,512
So let's go test that out really quick and
make sure that's working the way we want it
to

94
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:55,880
Let's make sure I don't lose while testing

95
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:10,381
Oh it's closeOkay perfect and we did see
that the villains Health did hit zero.

96
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:21,440
And while we're at it let's go ahead and add
like a victory for when we actually defeat
the

97
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:30,789
VillainSo we'll do the same thing here we'll
go ahead and say at an alert as well.

98
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:46,737
So we'll reuse that our old friendly emoji
fromCode works.

99
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:55,091
Coffee Co will use the tadaAnd we'll say the
code works.

100
00:14:56,894 --> 00:15:02,416
Crusader vanquishedThe coding virus.

101
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:09,946
And then we'll just say you wonAnd let's we
get that emoji the tada. Sweet.

102
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:14,925
Just a little extra touch when you actually
win

103
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:21,447
Great so let's go back to that drink potion

104
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:55,648
I'll be back
