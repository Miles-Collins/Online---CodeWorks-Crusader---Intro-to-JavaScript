1
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:11,330
So from here we want to have some sort of
indicator to say if I have a potion

2
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:17,236
So let's create a new variable and we're
going to say has health potion up here

3
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:24,175
And we're going to set SteveAnd we're going
to set its default value to false.

4
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:32,925
And while we're up here we can go ahead and
say like hero nameEquals the code Works
crusader.

5
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,381
And we'll set the villain name as well

6
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:50,516
And this is going to be the coding virusAnd
at this point you might be able to recognize
it.

7
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:56,419
What we did earlier with creating objects we
could probably do the same thing here

8
00:00:57,937 --> 00:01:05,664
So I'm actually going to create a cons
hereI'm going to call this the hero. And
this is going to equal this object.

9
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:10,671
I'm going to have nameEqual the code Works
crusader.

10
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:20,653
And I need to make sure I have this comma
hereWill do health is 100. And has health
potion.

11
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:27,634
Is going to be falseI'm going to just. We'll
say.

12
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:43,388
And we'll just say it's the refactored
version of above and then let's do the same
thing here with this villain

13
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:46,386
You can just say const villain

14
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:58,187
And we'll say the name and then we'll give
the health of 150 as well

15
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,095
Perfect so right now we should have some
errors

16
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,407
Well actually not excuse me because we still
have these variables up hereBut from here I
can actually Target.

17
00:02:13,153 --> 00:02:14,499
The hero.health

18
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,153
And I can actually just I'm going to use the
control D here I'm going to Target all my
villains health

19
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:29,116
Let's make sure that's all of themSee that's
going to be a problem there though.

20
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:34,436
This should be fine for now we'll say
villain DOT health

21
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:41,590
But I got to sneak in here I won't change
any of this but I do want it to equal my
villain to health here

22
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:46,634
Sweet awesome and I'm going to do the exact
same thing with my hero health

23
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:05,008
So it's fine my hero Health hereAnd then
we'll just Target all these hero health and
we'll say hero.health.

24
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:09,986
And then we'll change it here as well

25
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:20,582
And one last spot down in our drink potion

26
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,723
We'll change it to this objectAwesome.

27
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:36,549
Just a little bit better refactoring cuz

28
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:41,568
Like come into tomorrow's project that you
might be more comfortable just

29
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:45,750
creating that object instead of just
creating a bunch of variables that

30
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:53,797
Doesn't really tie too much to the hero
besides the fact that it's got the hero in
front of the name let's just create that
into an object

31
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:03,775
And I'll put the refactor from above as well

32
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:11,221
But now I have this property on my hero
object that has health potion

33
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:16,238
So I want to be able to check if hero has
health potion

34
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:38,165
So if we actually there's a two ways we can
handle this we can either put this
exclamation point

35
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:45,048
And let's give ourselves an alertWe're just
going to return this cuz we wanted it to
hard stop here.

36
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:52,834
So we'll say sorry youDo not have. A health
potion.

37
00:04:55,664 --> 00:05:01,693
Unless just make sure we rub insult to
injury and we'll say add in our little test
tube here

38
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:05,489
Sweet so let's save that and go to our web
application

39
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:14,796
And if I try to hit potion nowWe get this
alert that says sorry you don't have that
health potion.

40
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:20,280
And because we're returning it I also won't
get any help either

41
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:27,199
So now we need to add some sort of
functionality that can actually flip that
bull

42
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:36,443
Cuz right now no matter whatOr has health
potion is always going to remain false
because that's what it's set to but.

43
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:41,033
now we need to create some sort of function
that will flip this bull to true

44
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:46,628
Which will then allow me to actually
increase my Hero's Health by 25

45
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:14,965
And since all my main functionalities built
inside this attack

46
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm going to need some sort ofRoll for
potion here. Because I'm going to make some.

47
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:30,270
So I'm going to design this to give you a
percentage of a chance every time you attack
to essentially drop a potion

48
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:24,918
So it's actually create another function
after these since we're going to be working
within this attack

49
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:33,643
I'm going to make it underneath my hero
attack just to keep him in order and I'm
going to say function

50
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:42,279
We're going to sayWe'll say roll.

51
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:49,019
For health potion hereIt's going to have a
little bit of a D&D aspect to it.

52
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:57,928
So we're going to create this variable role
for health

53
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:04,939
And we'll do the same as earlier we'll do
our math that floor

54
00:08:06,974 --> 00:08:10,491
And we'll do a math.ranum and we'll multiply
this by 11

55
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:16,570
So we should have a number

56
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:26,810
Actually let's do something different on
this oneLet's multiply it by 10.

57
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:34,672
Cuz I don't want it to actually be zeroTo 10
I want this to be one through 10.

58
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,127
It's outside of this let's actually add this
one

59
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:53,456
So now this roll for health will always be a
number 1 through 10 because of that plus one
because the max number I can have is a 9
right now but because of

60
00:08:53,456 --> 00:09:01,202
that I can add the one and then the lowest
number I can have will always be a one
because if it's a zero it's going to get
that plus one as well

61
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:13,511
So now we get to create our opportunity to
actually get this potionSo we'll say if roll
for health is.

62
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:21,443
Greater than7.

63
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:27,275
Seven let's actually go to our hero

64
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:34,609
Get that has health potion Bowl so right now
we're going right back up here to line 10
we're saying hit this line

65
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,878
And now I want you to make it equal true

66
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:48,440
And after you do that let's do an alert so
we knowAnd we'll say you found a health
potion.

67
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:57,094
And let's let's put that test tube in there
it I like the way it looksThat's a little
extra Flair.

68
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:08,533
So let's save thisAnd let's make sure we
actually add it to this attack function as
well.

69
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:13,190
Cuz if we don't add it to this we'll never
actually be able to see it pop up

70
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:24,234
So at this point I should have a30% chance
to find a potion sweet.

71
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:31,281
And what's that a little strategyMake sure
I'm at least below 100.

72
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:39,026
To actually now get that random luck chance
so it's still just a game of luck

73
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:47,241
But this point it adds a little more Flair
to itOh man I'm getting really lucky here
but.

74
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,773
I'm trying to think really quick if anything

75
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:06,758
But this refactoring and putting them in
those private functionsMakes it so at any
point now.

76
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:14,230
We can change one thing in that functionSo
if I feel like okay maybe this is too easy
now.

77
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:22,454
Let's create this it needs to be higher than
eight or maybe that you only have a 1% orAn
actual 10% it has to equal 10.

78
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:27,563
So it's going to make it really hard so you
have a 10% chance

79
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:34,839
You can do different things just to increase
orIncrease the difficulty.

80
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:43,485
So now let's just add some quick
functionality to my health potion

81
00:12:56,489 --> 00:13:03,538
We'll say if the hero will make sure weSet
it to 100 but we'll also just return.

82
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:12,688
And we'll keep this test tube thing going
we'll get the test tube in thereOr our
secret concoction.

83
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:19,603
And say you cannot drink a potionIf your
health is full.

84
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:31,339
Awesome let's do one more check as wellCuz
we don't want any any healing going on if.

85
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:38,838
You are your hero the code Works Crusader
hasIt's no longer with us.

86
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:14,463
I just realized this this is never going to
hit this alert we'll go back to itSo.

87
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:19,152
If we're at 0 or less than 0 Let's return
this alert here

88
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:26,189
And we'll just say you can't drinkIf you're
dead.

89
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:37,159
Let's actually add some crossbones here
yeahSpice it up a little bit.

90
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:48,178
And I noticed just thinking about after this
wasWrote in is.

91
00:14:55,258 --> 00:15:02,806
This isn't going to work properly in the way
I want it toCuz it's going to. Put it back
to 100.

92
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,717
But then it's going to also

93
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:16,935
YeahSo this isn't going to work the way I
wanted to work right now.

94
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:24,839
Cuz right now I do want this to reset it
back to 100 century when I drink a potion
and it's going to over

95
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,651
go over the hundred I want to actually set
to 100 but I want this to return if my
health is above 100

96
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:38,161
So because it's always going to be at 100 at
this point this will actually never get
returned because it's never going to be over
or

97
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,058
Let me actually said that's not women

98
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:48,727
I just want to make two functions I'm at the
two

99
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,666
So right now I have it so

100
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:58,189
If his health goes over a hundred set it
back to 100 and then it's going to hit this
if your potion is you can't drink potion

101
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:05,405
if you're full I don't necessarily want that
to trigger every single time I just over
heal myself essentially so let's make an
else if here

102
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:13,122
And then we'll actually put if the hero
healthIs greater than 100 as well.

103
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:20,551
I kind of want to make these quick checks in
hereSo it's actually return this alert here.

104
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:25,472
So if I don't have a health potion I
shouldn't even be able to drink at all

105
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:32,191
But if I do have a health potion and my
health is well actually do both if

106
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:45,812
Move this guy here so we're pretty much
saying if all this happens

107
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:56,570
All the bad things that can happen now let's
go ahead and returnHero.health.

108
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,029
Plus equals 25

109
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:24,443
So I got to return there so we'll get it
else so say else

110
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:43,606
We can get rid of thisAnd at this point we
can actually do.

111
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,920
A ternary

112
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:54,375
And let's actually just create so a ternary
is going to be like an if statement so let's
get rid of here

113
00:19:56,148 --> 00:20:04,001
Get rid of that and what's create ternary
based off this if statementSo the first part
of the ternary.

114
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,130
Is going to be essentially this conditionSo
I'm going to say if hero.health.

115
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:16,975
Is greater than 100And this is going to look
weird the first few times you try.

116
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:26,175
InThis is going to look weird the first few
times you actually make a ternary cuz we're
going to have this question mark.

117
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:35,727
And then this if this is true if my hero
health is above 100 let's go ahead and make
hero Health equal

118
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:43,220
100But if it's fall so if it is.

119
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,618
Nothing changes we could do

120
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,625
We do know empty string

121
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:08,474
Hold on hold on Zach I'm looking at Best
Practices

122
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:28,456
JavaScript I don't care about JavaNot right
now at least sir. 2021.

123
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,412
I don't know that the guy not even make a
ternary

124
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:07,945
With the hit

125
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:36,045
OkayI'll be back I'm going to stop recording
and make sure it's working.
