1
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:08,689
Okay dope it workedWe ain't making a
ternary.

2
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:28,696
Sorry I'm not 100% sure how you can fit this
inSo instead underneath hero dot help let's
create a.

3
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:34,424
If true condition so we'll say if
hero.health

4
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:38,810
Is greater than 100 we're going to use these
double ampersands

5
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:43,684
And what this is saying is if this condition
to the left is true

6
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:48,747
Let's go ahead and reassign hero.health to
equal 100

7
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:58,294
Let's actually wrap this up it's mad at me
cuz I don't have this in the parentheses so
sweet

8
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:02,068
At this point let's go ahead and we can just
get rid of all this

9
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:13,709
We can actually add this and here as well
because this is just returning alert to this
point so

10
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:21,049
At this point we make sure we check that
bull so if hero has potion health or has
health

11
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:27,161
potion is false we're going to send them
back this alert essentially this is going to
be our air

12
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:34,504
Now I'm going to do that then we're going to
check to see if the hero health isGreater
than equal to 100.

13
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:41,855
And then we'll check if it's below zero or
equal and then if all those factors aren't
true let's go ahead and actually

14
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:48,433
increase the health and set it to 100 if it
is at 100 and then let's draw the health at
that point

15
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:52,761
Perfect

16
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:10,605
Oh sorry I stopped meant to stop recording
