1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:09,603
So now that we have our potion implemented
in the fashion that we want

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,636
So now that our potion is implementing
implemented so now that are potion

3
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:22,952
is implemented in the function in the way
the function in the

4
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:28,680
So now that our potion is implemented into
our project

5
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:35,074
In the fashion that we want in the fashion
what am I supposed to say

6
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,380
I'm just going to say it Blaine excuse me
wow

7
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:53,324
So now that our potion is implemented into
our project how we want it to be let's go
ahead and add some extra Flair

8
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:59,501
So when I draw my health now I wanted to
show some

9
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:04,285
crossbones actually instead of just zero
when my health is actually zero

10
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:09,262
So how we can do that instead of just having
equals hero Health here

11
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:17,324
We can open this up using our back takes
like we talked about earlierAnd this will
give us access to string interpolation.

12
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:25,782
And inside of thisI'm going to actually
create this a.

13
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:33,712
Curlies around itAnd add this dollar sign
now since I've added the curly brackets and
it's.

14
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:39,200
dollar sign I can also use JavaScript
functionality within this these curly
brackets

15
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:46,936
So from here I can say when hero.health is
greater than zero

16
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,659
I'm going to use a ternary to say the first

17
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,650
So I'm going to use a ternary to say if
hero.health is greater than zero if that is
true

18
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:14,123
I want you to just assign hero.health or
excuse me that's the only wayHero.health
here.

19
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:22,418
But we'll use this colon here to separate if
that's not true let's actually use a skull
and crossbone again

20
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,419
And we'll put three of them there

21
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:38,320
So what's going on here with this ternaryIs
this is going to be my condition.

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,559
Just like in a conditional for an if
statement we provide a condition so it's
actually two

23
00:02:54,228 --> 00:03:01,317
YeahMy if statement is is if hero DOT health
is greater than zero.

24
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:07,160
And then we have this ternaryAnd this is
due.

25
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:17,005
She will let's give a one cuz I do want to
give a little space hereFor this and we'll
say.

26
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,107
If it's zero doIf true.

27
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:31,157
Then we'll add someElse.

28
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,880
If Falls

29
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:45,940
So essentially ifThe heroes health is
greater than zero.

30
00:03:55,228 --> 00:04:00,614
Return just return Heroes healthElse.

31
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:03,368
Return triple crossbones

32
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:20,484
And that is essentially what a ternary is
cuz the other use case of a ternaries you
always want to return something out of it

33
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:28,632
And that's why we actually didn't use a
ternary down hereWe use the double Anderson
to just return.

34
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:37,137
Essentially if this is trueBecause right
here I didn't have anything to return if it
was false so we would use a double Amber
stands for that.

35
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:56,101
So let's go down and do the same exact thing
for this villain's healthUnless go ahead and
copy it.

36
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:05,115
And let's just change his heroWe'll just
highlight hero double click it hit that
control d.

37
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:07,828
And we'll just type in them there as well

38
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:17,624
AwesomeSo at this point let's go to our web
application.

39
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:30,924
UnlessAnd let's see if we can get those
crossbones up into the sweet I found a
health potion.

40
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:43,134
So if you don't actually want to go through
this right now like if you're trying to test
this out what you can do is go to your
devtools here

41
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:50,775
And I can actually say hero.healthEquals.
Zero.

42
00:05:54,138 --> 00:06:00,395
So the next time I attack it's going to say
he's dead awesome I get my triple crossbones
as well

43
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,635
I found a health potionAnd I can't drink if
you're dead sweet.

44
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:14,325
So let's also check the same for my
villainSo we can actually dive into.

45
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:21,032
That villain object and we'll just say
villain's Health equals one so we can see it
happen live

46
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:29,605
Awesome we vanquished themTook a little bit
of damage but now we can see the villain
health is indeed dead as well perfect.
