1
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:17,776
So at this point we have the majority of the
functionality of this application

2
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:22,195
so I'm going to show off some cool flutter
you can add since

3
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:26,371
Give it some more of that gamer gamification
if you will

4
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:33,997
I'll just show off how we can add different
things even though we might not want to keep
all of it

5
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:44,103
So it's actually throw another alert here so
we get our attack here

6
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:48,815
So once we have our hero attack let's say

7
00:00:52,861 --> 00:01:00,233
What use are double Ambersons again so we'll
say if hero attackEquals zero.

8
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:09,470
Let's just returnThis alert here.

9
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,182
So anger

10
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:31,187
So far hero attack here is zero let's go
ahead and return an alert

11
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:35,059
And we'll use our anger Emoji here

12
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:41,728
And we'll say the code Works to say they're
missed so if he hits for zero

13
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,729
Well just essentially say that he missed
here

14
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:54,012
And it'll pop up this alert the only thing
with using alerts is they can get kind of
annoying

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,885
And let's show that off cuz you could
probably see what the health potions every
time an alert comes up

16
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:04,973
You do have to click it away it won't
continue

17
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:13,027
We'll definitely have more options later on
the course I'll make this a lot easierI'm
just trying to get a.

18
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:17,123
One intention I am getting really lucky with
potions

19
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:32,159
So there we get this the code Works to say
they're missedUp at the top.

20
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:39,923
And I think our potions is a little broken
right now we seem to be getting a lot of
potions

21
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:44,650
But you can see the more we add this is just
kind of for your own personal projects

22
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,667
if you want to add this to your projects
it's just a cool little things you can do

23
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:56,526
So I don't mind that one but let's go look
at our potion really quick

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,293
So we'll go to a role for Health it

25
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:16,676
Oh so right now I have if it's a less than
eight we need to make that if it's greater
than eightThere we go that'll fix that.

26
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:20,864
It's just a little things you will notice as
your bill not your projects

27
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:30,409
For getting how to do greater than or less
than can make something come across a hard
or really easy

28
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:42,223
And even for them like my villain here you
can do cool things

29
00:03:47,244 --> 00:03:49,479
Just the same with their villain attack

30
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:03,331
Where you can say ifThe filling.

31
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:10,188
Attack is greater than or equal toWe'll say
12.

32
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:15,090
We can actually just give an alert as well

33
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:27,844
And we can actually let's use our string
interpolation as well againI mean say.

34
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:36,185
It's very busy faceCoding virus.

35
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,690
Hit us four and then we'llJust for and then
we'll just string interpolate that boss damn
or villain attack.

36
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:56,727
And then we'll just say that's a
criticalBlow. We'll put dizzy in there
again.

37
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,844
Or maybe exploding head

38
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:11,456
So we're saying if he hits us for a big
chunk of change will pretty much indicate
that that was a critical attack

39
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:14,238
And we can also have that pop up as well

40
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:26,153
So let's see if we can actually get that
critical blow to show up

41
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,893
Oh no I missedOof we get that the code Works
hit us for 14 a critical blow nice.

42
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,196
Oh and IJust realized a problem with this
application.

43
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:53,471
Right now I can actually use the potion as
many times as I want

44
00:05:55,433 --> 00:06:01,253
And that's because when I drink my potion
I'm not sitting that fool back to false

45
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:10,612
So every time I drink a potion

46
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,786
I want to increase my healthSet it back 200.

47
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:46,155
I want to draw my health and then before I
actually end this let's go ahead and get my
hero and has health potion

48
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:55,992
And let's make that false nowSo now when I
refresh.

49
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,284
I will actually got a potionBut now since I
got another potion.

50
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:11,834
So I can drink my potion now but if I come
to drink it again

51
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:19,400
It's going to say I do not have a health
potion because that bull is now been flipped
back to falseAwesome.

52
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:35,113
So at this point the main functionality of
this app is made

53
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:40,840
And I always think it's important to
actually I'm going to be right back I'm
going to get some drink
