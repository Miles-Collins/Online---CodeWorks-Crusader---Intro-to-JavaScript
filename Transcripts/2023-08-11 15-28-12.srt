1
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:12,045
So now that the functionality of this webLet
me rephrase it so now that the functionality
of our.

2
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:15,542
Little clicker game is made and set up

3
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:22,830
We know we have the foundation of our
website reallyIn great condition.

4
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:31,263
And this is always the most important part
of a websiteCuz sometimes.

5
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:42,089
People will actually have a habit which can
kind of be a bad habit to overstow so pretty
much make the style of the

6
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:49,376
website what it look like on when I was
showing it off without actually making any
functionality so they'll have the buttons
where

7
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:56,663
they need to go they'll have the dudes
looking really cool but they'll spend way
too much time and focus on maybe the

8
00:00:56,663 --> 00:01:03,950
way it looks but in reality when it's
someone starts to try when someone starts to
interact with those objects they do nothing

9
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,221
It can be kind of disappointing toLet me
rephrase that.

10
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:19,703
It can be a very disappointing experience
for a user if they're on your website and
they're excited to play the

11
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:27,447
game that you have built out for him and
nothing works and they're just clicking buns
that actually don't do anythingSo.

12
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:33,020
It's always really important to remember
functionality before form is like to say get
all the functionality

13
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,214
working and then let's actually design this
website to look the way we wanted to look

14
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,815
So let's go ahead and head back to vs code

15
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:58,267
And let's start actually working on those
stylesFrom here I'm actually going to import
some assets.

16
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:11,962
And then we got our attack button in here we
got some other buttons in here as well or
some other images rather

17
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:20,920
So let's go to our index.html we'll close
this out

18
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:32,184
And now let's get into just dialing out this
page the way we want

19
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:45,546
So we'll go back since now we're actually
going to style it the way the finished
product look we'll convert this back to a
container fluid

20
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:52,420
cuz we want this to look like the entire
Battlefield we want the whole viewport to be
that battlefield of those two fighting each
other

21
00:02:55,127 --> 00:03:01,555
We'll get rid of this padding as well since
we won't have the buttonsThe way that they
were designed.

22
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:07,403
And we're actually going to do a two call
fives here

23
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:14,699
Cuz if you remember from the reference it
was built out we kind of want those two
individual buttons in the middle

24
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,627
So having two call fives on both sides
allows us to actually put our buns in
between these

25
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:29,691
We can actually put our buttons hereAnd a
call to within the same row.

26
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,268
So let's just go ahead and move

27
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:48,529
These buns up into there so we'll just
actually move the individual ones

28
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,555
And after we move these up here we will also
make sure to get rid of

29
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:07,793
Those days down here so let's go ahead and
clean this up as well let's make sure we get
the entire rowGet him out of there. Sweet.

30
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:18,796
So at this point let's go to our web appWe
can see we get those two buttons in the
middle awesome.

31
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,808
So we'll wrap this attack in a PTACWe'll say
attack.

32
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:04,457
Let's actually we'll do text uppercase on
this P tag as well

33
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:14,903
And let's also addSome red to it so we'll do
danger text.

34
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,462
And this will be a custom CSS class will
make in our own CSS and let's actually open
this up as well

35
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:39,671
And we'll do the same thing for this
potionSo let's actually put a P tag in here
and we'll call this one potion.

36
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:45,275
And we'll actually call this success text

37
00:05:55,131 --> 00:06:01,464
And we're going to add some of our own
custom CSS to this as wellAnd let's do.

38
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:11,827
To uppercase as well so we'll do text
uppercaseSweet.

39
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,715
So let's go back up to our row and we'll add
some more classes to our row

40
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:29,703
Let's just fire content betweenAnd let's
align our items to the center.

41
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:36,568
The next class I want to add in is going to
be called the battlefield

42
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:45,469
This is going to be that background image we
had when we looked on it our previous or a
reference project

43
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:49,510
But if we save for now and let's go back

44
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:58,322
We actually see some getting some centerness
centerness and we canGet our buttons in
here.

45
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:11,038
But let's not go to our styles.css we'll get
rid of this hello world and

46
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:17,152
we'll actually create that Battlefield class
and we'll create that text success as
wellSo.

47
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:23,980
Let's access that and we'll go to the
battlefieldAnd I want to set this to a
dynamic view height.

48
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:32,540
Of that 100 viewportI'm going to access a
background image.

49
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:38,905
And it's very important once again to make
sure we target that URL

50
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:49,138
And then make sure we put those quotes
around

51
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:56,055
And Lincoln that are tag or our and make
sure we Link in the address of that image

52
00:07:57,308 --> 00:08:03,556
SweetSo if we were just to save this we
should get a background image but it's
probably not going to look that good.

53
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:17,839
So now we get the tach potion and then we
can kind of see the text but it's a little
dark but we get

54
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:24,950
that background but it's just going to keep
repeating over itself as well just because
it's native sizes and the size of this
viewport

55
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:37,183
So let's go back to our CSS and we can
change that background sizeBy accessing the
background size.

56
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:43,712
We'll just have cover for thatAnd then we'll
also Target the background position.

57
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:47,254
And we're going to just make sure it's
centered on the screen

58
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:58,895
So now we get that big background to set up
our battlefield for our hero and the coding
virus

59
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,501
While we're here I'm going to set up a new
section I'm going to call this section my
text section

60
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:17,088
Let's actually make those two texts that we
set up earlier so we'll do a danger text

61
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:23,852
this is going to be very similar to just
text danger but I'm going to addI'm going to
add a little bit of font weight to it.

62
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:30,889
WhoopsSo let's target font weight.

63
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:37,545
Let's give it a heftiness so we'll give it
800 which is going to make it quite a bit
more bold

64
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,175
And then we'll also add some text Shadow to
it

65
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,349
I'm going to add some white text Shadow so
let's say this and look at it

66
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:57,686
So awesome we get thatNice effect with the
white.

67
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,291
So it's add the same to our potion

68
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:11,281
So for this one I'm going to do pretty much
the same except instead of red we're going
to use the success of green

69
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:21,567
It's like I said will do essentially the
same thing we'll use Font weight 800

70
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:29,857
And then we'll actually just go ahead and
copy this text shadow inSave that. And let's
take a look at it.

71
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:37,975
Sweet so we got our two button set upLet's
continue back in our HTML.

72
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:57,097
So now that we're into section Hero Let's go
ahead and label this sectionIt's actually go
ahead and label all these sections.

73
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,005
Let me look up a semantics thing

74
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:22,373
I'm pretty sure they can call looms I
misspelled columns are concessions be
columns

75
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,092
HTML

76
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:35,312
So remember we were reading something about
you should use sections over divs

77
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:38,905
I feel like this would be a good use case
for that

78
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,740
Whatever I'm not to worry about it doesn't
really it was more of a semantic thing

79
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:58,589
So let's target this call five and all this
call five I'm going to make the text Center

80
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:06,272
And I'm going to set another unique class
cuz I need to set the height of this parent
call five here

81
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:15,902
And we'll go to our Styles at CSSSo I have
my text we won't create this in my text.

82
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:34,749
Can I just want the height of this divThis
parent did to be 75% and I'll show off what
that's going to do.

83
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,751
Just make sure everything's saved

84
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:48,185
You see immediately we get our heroes Health
at the top and let's actually inspect this
to see the difference of what's going on in
between these two

85
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,768
Cuz right now we can see this is that parent
row

86
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:59,209
And if you notice we get a lot more height
and coverage of the entire viewport then if
I go to this villains

87
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:10,319
If I click on the actual row you can see the
row is only going to be the height of the
children within it

88
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:16,589
that row but if we were to do the same thing
for this villain height and set it to a
static height of 75%

89
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:24,092
We can actually get this to grow to the size
that we want in spite of the contents within
the container itself

90
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:41,172
But from here we'll continue with the hero
section we'll add aJustify content Center to
this.

91
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:48,426
Rose well cuz we're going to want the hero
and all the health within here to be
centered on the screen

92
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:52,697
So within here so within here

93
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:58,808
So within this row we'll actually go ahead
and change it to a call 10 so it won't be so
wide

94
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:06,074
Instead of having toInstead of having to
Hero's Health let's actually make this the
code Works Crusaders.

95
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:13,021
And since we capitalize everything I'll just
make this age capitalize

96
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:24,217
And let's actually set this font size so
let's give this a font size of three

97
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:30,065
And what's create another class called the
header text which will use for this and the
villain as well

98
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,010
So let's go create that within our text
section

99
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:50,341
So we'll do that by just opening up that
header text and actually scroll down here

100
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:56,112
I'm going to set the color of that text to
White

101
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,238
And we'll apply text Shadow to it as well
just to allowed to pop out a little bit more

102
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:13,436
And we'll give it a blackShadow. And let's
add a little bit of a border here.

103
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:20,827
And we're actually going to make this border
dotted so let's save thatAnd go take a look
at what that looks like.

104
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:28,862
Awesome so now we applied that font size 3

105
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:35,350
So we set the phone a lot higher we also
made the font white and we create that kind
of that black

106
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:39,375
Text Shadow on as well and a white dotted
border

107
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:46,412
And I'll show off the text Shadow itself so
we can seeThe.

108
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:50,834
Code Works Health right there so it's
actually go to this header text

109
00:15:53,644 --> 00:16:00,412
And we'll actually open this up a little bit
moreLet's go to our elements or.

110
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:10,421
So let's take a look at what that text
shadow

111
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:18,929
So that's the difference of having text
Shadow and not like I said it just makes it
look a lot softer

112
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:24,636
and not so sharp or have that glow and it
just looks better as well depending on the
background was white

113
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:30,715
That's why I like to add a text Shadow to
just open text on that's kind of floating
around

114
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,206
And if you know the background might not be
black

115
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:50,207
So from here we'll continue downTo our
actual hero.

116
00:16:57,377 --> 00:17:00,364
So make sure to go down underneath this row

117
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:13,078
We're going to add an image tagAnd this
source is going to be from the images I
added earlier.

118
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:17,667
And it's going to be this pixel hero.png

119
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:24,944
And then I'm going to sign a alt tag of here
that's the code Works crusaderImage.

120
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,689
And I also want to send an ID

121
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:37,113
So I can access this from my JavaScript if I
want to add any

122
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:42,161
if I want to add any JavaScript or custom
CSS from later on

123
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:52,938
Let's go ahead and also add a title to this
will add the title of what I should say the
code Works crusader

124
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:02,008
And also add a class to this as well and
this is going to take on the

125
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:10,590
Same class from earlier we're actually just
going to reuse that Crusader height is 75%

126
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,806
So let's take a quick look at what this
looks like
