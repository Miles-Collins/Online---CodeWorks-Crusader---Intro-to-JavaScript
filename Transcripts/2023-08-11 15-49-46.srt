1
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:08,380
So now we get the code Works Crusader on our
screen

2
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:16,304
And the position that we want them to be in
awesome so now we just need to go back to
our HTML and actually add in his name
beneath

3
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:23,760
So now we actually need to go back to our
HTML and add his name beneath

4
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:41,289
So from here let's actually go underneath
this image check and we'll add in our own P
tag and we're just going to say the code
Works Crusader here

5
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:51,114
We're not doing anything too fancy here we
just want to make the font sizeEssentially
an H1 and we also want to add in this light
text.

6
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:55,224
So let's go to our Styles at CSS and create
that class

7
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:09,217
Sooner Styles at CSS let's just go ahead and
create light textYou scroll down here.

8
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:18,081
And this is going to be obviouslyA light
color. But we're going to want to make sure
we add in that text shadow.

9
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:24,126
When I use the zero pixel zero pixel 5 pixel
and we're going to make it black

10
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:32,422
After this we're going to add in our text
decorationYou can get dotted.

11
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:38,326
- double line through underlineAnd that's
which one we're going to choose here we're
going to get that underline.

12
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:46,284
So save that and head to our applicationNow
we get the.

13
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:51,730
World renowned coder the code Works Crusader
over here

14
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:06,906
And at this point I'm going to come back to
the buttons but I kind of want to work on
the boss now just to get that visually
appealing battle going on

15
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:15,770
And I can always recommend Also let's go
ahead and test this outSo our health is
still going down properly awesome.

16
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:23,023
Sweet so let's go actuallyLet's go get our
villain over there on the right.

17
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:34,281
So let's head down to our villainAnd we'll
start the same way we did the other one so
let's just use text Center.

18
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,893
And then we'll say Crusader height here as
well

19
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:11,462
But now reading the state high on the
villain I kind of want to change the name

20
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:19,805
So let's actually change this Crusader
heightWe'll change this to height.

21
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:25,711
75 I don't thinkSo we'll change this to
height 75.

22
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:31,081
And let's just actually go up here and
change this to height 75 as well

23
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:52,974
Just to add more reusability because
technically at that point

24
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,381
Is it fine to continue using a class name
that isn't implied for that section 100%
that's okay but

25
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:07,443
I just want to keep some reusability dude I
should have originally started with like
something height 75 but

26
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,700
From here we can go down to our next row

27
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:22,669
And this is going to look very similar to
our hero we'll just do just by content
Center for that as wellWill change this
column here to a call 10.

28
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:30,208
And from here we will change us from the
villains height to the coding virusesHealth.

29
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,711
And from here we'll add that font size to
this as wellLet's make this a font size 3.
And.

30
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:44,943
Three and we'll also add in that custom
header text on it as well

31
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:54,885
And I am going to spice it up here

32
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:00,735
And change this to 250 we're going to make
him a little bit stronger I feel like the
game was a little too easy

33
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:09,060
So if we change it to 250 here cuz this is
going to be the starting point we need to
make sure we go to our JavaScript

34
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:15,739
Unless actually set the villains healthTo
250 here.

35
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:28,384
And will probably have some problemsLater on
as well and I can show you how we can clean
that up to make this more reusable as well.

36
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:38,134
But we'll do that after we get this image on
here so we'll go to this row like I said
make sure we'll

37
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:43,432
go outside this room and we'll do the same
thing with this we'll create an image with
the source of our assets

38
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:51,242
And we'll get the coding virus in hereAnd
we'll do an all tag of.

39
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:58,928
Coding virus bossWill add a title of. The
coding virus.

40
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:09,225
And I'll also add an ID here for coding
virus as well if we want to like say do any
cool stuff later on we'll

41
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:15,458
cuz I plan on adding some extra CSS here at
the end once we kind of get this running the
way we want it to

42
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,512
And lastly for this guy will add that final
P tag with just his name so we'll say the
coding virus

43
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:35,596
And will give it a font size of one and
we'll give it that light text as well so
let's go take a look at this

44
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,861
That's a big dude

45
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:49,310
So now I got the coding Mega virus
apparently

46
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:57,379
Over here just he actually looks kind of
cool but I'm getting some side school here
so it's just way off the screenDoing his own
thing.

47
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:03,569
And that's because I forgot to put that
height 75 on them and

48
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:07,941
he's just going to his native height and
he's going to he's massive

49
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:16,558
So from here I forgot to add that class like
we had on our hero and that's going to be
that height 75

50
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,040
All right now that looks like a little bit
more achievable

51
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:32,069
So now we have our code representer on the
left and our coding virus on the right and
you'll notice though when I attack

52
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:40,408
Everything is working the way I wanted to

53
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,173
And you can see these alerts in like said be
a little obnoxious sometimes but we get

54
00:07:56,432 --> 00:08:00,371
Leave I wanted to skip all the clickingYeah
we'll just.

55
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:09,251
At this point we got our coding virus on the
right or hero on the leftAll we have left is
to get these buttons looking the way we
want.

56
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:16,550
All we need to do all that's left is to get
these buttons to look the wayHow do I mess
this up twice.

57
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:23,408
All that's left to do is get these buns to
look the same way as they did in that
reference project

58
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:37,373
So let's now go to our buttonWe can already
have our own click on here and for both of
them in the type button which is awesome.

59
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:45,427
So from here we'll actually take off this
BTN outline dark and we'll just leave the
BTN on both of them

60
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:01,493
And from here I'm going to add an image tag

61
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:08,573
And the source of that image is going to be
once again in our assets and where I'm going
to get the attack PNG

62
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:14,018
And my ALT will beAttacked.

63
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:21,318
And I'm going to sign a title to this as
well and this is going to be the attack
button

64
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:30,763
It should figure it out based off this P tag
kind of being the identifier for this button
but

65
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:37,685
Worst case scenario you just spent a second
putting this title in but

66
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:41,761
make sure we always have these all tags in
once again for accessibility

67
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:51,016
And on this image I want to add a classAnd
I'm going to use that image food class.

68
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:56,662
I'm going to add in a custom CSS class of
attack Button as well

69
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:16,333
So down on the drink potion we're going to
do the same exact thing we're going to
Target that assets and we're going to Target
my

70
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:20,037
Magic transparent potion

71
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:31,339
And then we'll have our drink potion and
then I'll add in the same title for drink
potion button

72
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:43,328
And I'll add some and I'll add in some
custom CSS classes for this as well

73
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:55,350
And I'm going to reuse that attack button so
let's just go ahead and change this from a
tag button now

74
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:11,864
Let me ask you to look what my buns doing

75
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:45,632
And we'll just we'll actually tap into our
same styling as

76
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:49,759
bootstrap so I'll use BTN and then I'll just
say BTN

77
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:54,033
Custom let's just say custom for now
something simple

78
00:11:55,282 --> 00:12:01,083
Since we're going to use on both of these so
let's go ahead and go to our CSS and
actually style this button custom

79
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,621
So I'll make a new section for this and I'll
say buttons

80
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,986
And let's do our BTN custom here

81
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:34,186
And what we want our fun custom to do is
we're going to set this to a custom width of
95%And we're going to make this have a.

82
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:37,095
75% opacity

83
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,915
And when I go to hover on this B10

84
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:50,046
I wanted to then increase its opacity to one
so we want to make it completely visible

85
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:57,374
And I'm going to set the width to 100 so
this is going to give it an effect of making
it grow and become

86
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:06,001
More obvious as wellSo save everything and
let's head to our web application.

87
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:15,201
So just like that we now have our our
buttons here

88
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:25,899
So when I hover over this attack like I said
it starts kind of a little bit barely opaque
and when I actually highlight over it

89
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:33,180
makes it fully opaque and it kind of gives
it that slight grow as well just because I'm
increasing the width from 95 to 100

90
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,928
And the same effect works on this potion
down here as well

91
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:53,919
So very cool at this pointYou can call it
good and you could actually just finish this
project but from.

92
00:13:53,919 --> 00:14:01,878
here we're going to add some other cool
things we can do with our JavaScriptLike I
mentioned earlier I added those.

93
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:03,847
I added those IDs to the image tags

94
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:09,488
And at this point I want to make it so when
my heroes Health hits zero

95
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:13,225
I want to add some sort of feature that

96
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:22,149
Makes them grayed out or I can even change
this to possibly like a giant tombstoneAnd I
can do the same with the virus as well.

97
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,128
I don't like that though

98
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:01,422
So from here we can actually let's close up
some of this stuff here

99
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,460
We're going to go into our draw Health
function

100
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:44,612
And from here we can even take this a step
furtherAnd we can divvy out this so we can
actually say do this as draw hero.

101
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:49,858
And we can make another function for Dylan
as well

102
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,524
We'll actually stabilize draw hero health
and draw villain health

103
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,620
And let's actually just go ahead and cut
this up here

104
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:10,855
And then we'll do the same here

105
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:18,076
And then for our draw Health at this point
we can just call those in here
