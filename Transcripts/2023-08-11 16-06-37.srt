1
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:10,379
So the cool thing now is you can mess around
with these a little bit easier without
feeling like you're going to

2
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:14,329
Conflict with anything in the villain's
health

3
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:25,061
I forgot to actually invoke that awesome so
let's actually work with the hero's health
for now

4
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:32,862
So we've made those changes to our Crusaders
Health but I want to say if my crusader

5
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:41,240
Hero's health is less than or equal to
zeroLet's add that.

6
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:45,529
Change to him let's actually change that
image all together

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,166
So we already have access to our hero
elimFrom above so let's actually say oops.

8
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:06,496
NoSo in this.

9
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:12,668
So in this if statement let's go ahead and
go get my documentAnd we'll get element by
ID here.

10
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:19,572
And let's go get the code Works crusader

11
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:25,783
And let's actually make sure that is correct
cuz this is a common thing sometimes

12
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:31,536
you think you remember the ID so let's just
go ahead and double click itAnd bring it
over.

13
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,883
And on this one I'm going to call a unique

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,175
So now I'm going to call upon a unique
property

15
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:51,567
I can access a property called classless and
this classless if

16
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:55,963
I hit period again will give me all these
different

17
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:02,507
Well give me all these different methods I
can call upon

18
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,742
I can do an ad replace removing these this
is actually targeting that exact

19
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:14,434
ID and accessing all the classes so this I
want to add a class

20
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,213
In the class I want to add is going to be
dead crusader

21
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:30,193
I'll show that off with a debugger as well
what's going on hereBut first let's go
actually create that class.

22
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:40,688
So we'll actually have that deck Crusader at
the top here so we'll say dead crusader

23
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:48,072
And we want the content of this to be a

24
00:02:52,896 --> 00:03:00,419
We'll just have it so the content of this
will be image that we have overAnd then also
add a filter.

25
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:09,357
Of a grayscale and I want that gray scale to
be oneJust make sure to add our semicolons
are awesome.

26
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:15,390
So now if we save all thisAnd go to our web
application.

27
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:24,202
It's good work console and actually set my
Hero's Health to one

28
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:37,813
So now when I hit attack my hero
shouldPerish. And we should also hit that
debugger.

29
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:45,181
Oh right it's all in the wounds man critical
hit so I don't think I refreshed

30
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,256
So let's try it again

31
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:23,198
Oh

32
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:29,359
hero

33
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:35,520
health

34
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:04,901
So this is miles from the future and because
of this debugger I was able to actually
figure out

35
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,181
Hero.hero Health doesn't exist

36
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:15,349
So I was actually not getting the response
that I wanted to on the web application so
this is just

37
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:21,567
another showing debugging and figuring it
out so when I had gone to zero it skipped
over this conditional all

38
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:27,786
together and at that point I noticed that I
had the wrong property in there so let's try
this again

39
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:37,977
Discovered our web application refresh and
hit that inspect toolLet's go to console and
I'll set the hero's Health to one.

40
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:45,731
So now when I attackWe hit this debugger
inside this if statement.

41
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,755
And now it's going to go over to this
document get element by ID

42
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:55,818
And it's going to add that class list of
debt crusader

43
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:08,204
So we get this gravestone here andI also
want to show that off let's actually not do
with the debugger here though.

44
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:19,724
So I willConsole log here this is going to
be a little bit extra way to do this but.

45
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,939
So we'll go get this code Works crusaderIt's
actually just. Copy and paste that.

46
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,664
And I want to show off the difference of
before and after the hero dies

47
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:52,364
So let's do the same I will set his health
to oneAnd then I will get critically hit
again.

48
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:56,072
And the big thing here is if you notice
right now

49
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:03,905
He's got both of them on

50
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:28,963
That don't make no sense

51
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,848
WhyWhy. Maybe it's happening too quick.

52
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,593
What is going on

53
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,496
That's annoyingOkay whatever.

54
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,352
So if I highlight this code Works Crusader
right now

55
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:26,460
We can see and hear that right now we haveA
class on him.

56
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:35,314
It's actually closes up a little bit better
and the only class that exists on him is
this height 75Not if I set his health to
one.

57
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:38,608
And attack

58
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:46,632
No the coating virus actually missed

59
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:54,849
And now we get that console log back and we
can see it added this new class dead
crusader

60
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:05,657
Only when he his health gets blow zeros cuz
right now is healthyIsn't below zero so it
won't actually take effect.

61
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,190
But nowRip. We actually get that class added
on there.

62
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:19,464
And that's all because of this classless
property here

63
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:29,089
And because of this dot ad so if you could
always highlight over this it will actually
show you the MDM reference which is really
handy

64
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:35,029
Like says it's just this property just
allows for manipulation of the elements
class content

65
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:38,717
And we're able to do that also because of
the add method

66
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:44,780
So anything I passed through here it's going
to add that to its class

67
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:04,693
So at this point we're going to do the same
exact thing with this villainSo we'll say
if.

68
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:10,395
The Honda helpIt's less than or equal to
zero.

69
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:22,509
Let's go get that document the same wayAnd
let's make sure we get the right index.

70
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:34,414
And we're going to do the same exact thing
we're going to access that classless
property and we're going to use the add
method

71
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:38,802
And on this one I want to add the class of
dead virus

72
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:45,386
So let's actually code out that's going to
be

73
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:58,426
So for dead virus we're not going to be so
dramatic with the gravestone he doesn't get
his own gravestone He's the bad guy

74
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:06,873
We're going to actually add in that filter
of grayscale as wellWhich should gray out
his character.

75
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:14,693
And then let's also transform we're going to
we're going to flip them upside down so
we're going to scale on the Y axi

76
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:18,608
And we're going to do a negative one so
we're going to flip it all the way around

77
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,699
If I chose the X here it would actually flip
around the horizontal and I'll show that off
as well

78
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:31,685
So if weSo if I set the villain tell to one
now.

79
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:41,546
We said that to oneAnd now when I attack.

80
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:49,095
We get the code Works virus flipped around
on its head and gray scaled out

81
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,723
Like I said if I would have done scale why
or X here let's show that off instead

82
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:09,271
Let's set the health to oneAnd attack them.

83
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:15,090
He just kind of dances and turns away like
he's going to run away

84
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:22,752
I don't want to make it look like he's
running away I want to make sure it is
implied that we have vanquished this
baddieAnd.

85
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:30,153
Oh yeah there is one thing I want to show
off

86
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:49,398
So as of now this application is somewhat
difficult actually

87
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:59,561
Because we don't have it set up to
accumulate potionsBecause if I don't
actually use my potion right now and I hit
twice.

88
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:09,792
I pretty much waste the potionSo we can add
in a kind of a.

89
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,161
Dicey way

90
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:21,324
Making our potions kind of delayed so
technically if I am fast enough I can
actually click this again

91
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,587
While it's still accumulatingAnd let's do
that by actually creating a set timeout.

92
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:51,730
So our main.js is actually go to our drink
potion

93
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:58,487
And all this is going to be perfect the way
it is

94
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:10,964
But now we're going to add a little bit of
functionality with our set timeoutIn a set
timeout.

95
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:20,767
Takes intoTakes into arguments.

96
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:23,975
It takes in a Timeout number

97
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:31,379
In the function that you want to actually
send through it so the function will be
first so we'll

98
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,702
actually we're going to make a health up
function and I want this to occur after
three seconds

99
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:41,511
So now I need to actually create that Health
up

100
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:50,759
Cuz right now if I say this and we go over
and try to drink our potion

101
00:14:55,486 --> 00:15:01,005
We should encounter an areaWhoops when I
drink my potion.

102
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:12,461
Oh yes this is because I just actually made
that functionSo technically if I comment
this out.

103
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,782
When I hit this potion I shouldIf I actually
get a potion first.

104
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:40,449
Oh my goodness so let's give myself a potion
here

105
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:51,708
Just get a little bit of attackWhen I click
on this potion we get that reference air
help is not defined.

106
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:58,309
I kind of skipped ahead there and I already
made that function

107
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:04,180
So now we actually have a function that's
calling to hear it's not doing anything but
it won't air out

108
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:13,768
So within this health up function we want to
still do everything that we're doing in
pretty much right here

109
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:16,341
We're just going to move it down

110
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:24,449
We just want everything to be on a timeout
of 3 seconds so we kind of want when you hit
that button

111
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:29,217
It's not going to increase your health by 25
until after 3 seconds

112
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,918
So let's save that and show off kind of
what's going on thereSo like I said before.

113
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:56,141
If I use the health potion right now it
wouldn't make sense because I don't have 25
Health

114
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:01,905
but now I can use that health potion it's
not going to go on for another 3 secondsAnd
there it went.

115
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,595
So just gives the user more time to actually
click that potion

116
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:19,016
So once again I get that health potion I got
the three seconds

117
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:32,871
Or you can sit here and wait toIf you're
really low. Oh dang he smoked me.

118
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:05,088
And that's how we can use our set timeouts
the main thing to always remember oh sorry

119
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:08,326
And that's how we will be using our set
timeout

120
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:17,292
The main thing to remember is that function
needs to go in this first argument and the
time limit and

121
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:23,895
once again this is in millisecond so 3,000
milliseconds will be 3 seconds and it will
occur after 3 seconds

122
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:31,427
So another cool little thing I'm just going
to add is a page load

123
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:39,921
And I'll actually set this to the topSo
function page load. And.

124
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:44,118
This isn't going to beThis isn't going to be
for everyone this is just more of a.

125
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:52,459
Funny cool thing to add cuz I'm going to add
thisWindow alert that I made.

126
00:18:53,105 --> 00:19:00,428
And this is going to essentially as soon as
the page load and I'll have it set to the
top so I'm going to actually invoke this
within my JavaScript

127
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:05,558
And since it's at the top this is going to
happen before anything else happens within
this project

128
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:18,307
So from here if I refresh my page

129
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:25,577
I get this alert that gives me the storyline
of what the code Works Crusaders going to be

130
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:31,248
And then it's going to give me this will you
have what it takes to Vanquish the coding
virus maybe we'll see

131
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:35,488
And now you kind of get that introduction to
that actual web application
