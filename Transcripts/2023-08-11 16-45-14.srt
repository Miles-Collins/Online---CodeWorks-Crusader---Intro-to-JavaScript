00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:14,929
This is one of those instances where you
canSit here and style a project forever and
get it to look exactly the way you want.

2
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:22,507
But for now I just want to go over some of
the things we covered in today's lesson

3
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:28,864
First we started off with individual
variables for all this and then

4
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:33,839
We decided to actually create an object out
of those which will work a lot

5
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:38,325
better and make reusable code a lot easier
so when I want to actually

6
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,053
Change individual properties it changes for
all of them

7
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:52,695
We want to talk too much about this page
though that's just a little bit of extra
fluffI guess I shouldn't say that.

8
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:58,441
So we just did the page load and I won't go
too ended up with that that's just like a
little extra

9
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:05,085
Showing off if you will to just add
different functionality to your website if
you want

10
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:11,152
The big thing is we refactored our functions
for our attack

11
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:20,018
If you remember originally we had a single
attack function that did both the hero
attack the villain attack and it also drew
the health

12
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:25,179
And we actually refactor those into their
own separate functions

13
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,966
That increases readability and reusability
for if I ever want to actually call in that
hero attack maybe the hero attacks

14
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:39,414
when he gets critical hit if there's a
critical hit I can actually make my hero
respond and attack once more

15
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:47,467
And if I wanted that all at that point I
needed to do is actually call this function
into wherever that needs to go

16
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:57,468
We also went over some simple conditions
here so we just render these alerts whenever
the health is at or below zero and we did

17
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:04,985
the same thing for the villain this is just
going over how to use our conditionals and
how to actually pass these arguments within
them

18
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:10,560
We showed off using the math-up floor mat
that random to get a random generate

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,623
number for in this instance it's going to be
a number that's 0 through 10

20
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:35,078
We also sold this ifIf true then render the.

21
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:43,226
Return that's after it so we'll sayIf above.
If this is true.

22
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:45,568
Return this

23
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,732
So it's a little bit simpler than using a
ternary because a ternary would be

24
00:02:54,732 --> 00:03:01,883
a bad use case here since I'm not returning
anything if it's actually falseSo I can just
make this if.

25
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,246
If true statement here return this alert

26
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:17,063
We also showed off making this variable hero
attack like I said and reducing the hero's
Health every time this is clicked

27
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:25,650
And the functionality for the villain attack
is going to be essentially the same we just
do some also checksTo make sure we're.

28
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:32,313
If the health is below zero on either one of
these that we're not going to allow that to
happen we're just going to return
immediately

29
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:41,964
After that we had our draw hero health and I
just want to go over making sure we got
these hero Health eels

30
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:47,062
And we go to our Dom and get that Ellen by
its ID that we

31
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:51,193
put on our index at HTML and we use this
ternary to set the health

32
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:59,309
To the hero Health if the health is above
zero but if that's false we said to these
three cost bones

33
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:03,750
And also showed off this cool way to add a
class

34
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,810
Whenever his health is actually at or below
zero

35
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:17,959
Then we worked on our health whichWe just
passed through both our draw hero health and
villain health.

36
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,590
And then we also did our drink potion

37
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:28,625
Which we made this if else statement here so
we kind of go from the top so obviously if
we don't have a potion we're going to alert
that

38
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:36,124
we don't if our health is already above 100
we can't drink a potion and if her health is
at or below zero we can't drink a potion
either

39
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:44,362
And then off all those are false we can go
ahead and actually set our time out to 3
secondsTo actually run this health up.

40
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:47,221
Which then increase our health by 25

41
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:56,270
And lastly we made this kind of this custom
function for that role for health potion

42
00:04:56,624 --> 00:05:03,074
And we reuse our math up floor mat that Ram
to get a random number between 1 and 10

43
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:08,265
And then if that number is above 8 we can go
ahead and flip that bull

44
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:12,944
on our object to true and that allows us to
actually use that health potion

45
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:30,227
I hope you enjoyed this lecture I know it's
a little bit if you're a gamer like me it's
cool seeing

46
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:35,778
the implementation of actually making these
games come to life and always feel free to
add like I said any little

47
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:41,328
extra things you want to add to your project
you can make it more complicated if you want
make it

48
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:45,608
Less complicated if you're not super into
games as well

49
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:51,299
Because I do know this is a topic that
sometimes people who aren't Gamers struggle
with is that gamer logic

50
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,915
Sometimes the best thing is just to keep it
simple and don't overcomplicate it

51
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:12,847
But thank you for following along and that
will be our intro to JavaScript lectureThank
you.
